A UI Test Framework

Webdriver IO Tests
=========================


## Todo
* Research and add functional tests using Webdriver IO


### Setup

```
npm install
```

### Building And Running

npm test

**NOTE** Allure-reporter generates allure report after every execution, in order to access the Allure Report

```
npm run report
```

**NOTE**
 You can delete the new allure folder everytime before running tests if you want to see fresh exection report while running locally. On jenkins, jenkins takes
 care of clearing workspace before starting execution.
